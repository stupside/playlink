# Playlink

## TODO

### Technical
- [ ] CSRF on /device/connect breaks
- [ ] Link the frontend and the extension with the backend
- [ ] Show the QR code on the frontend
- [ ] Add a QR Code scanner to the extension
- [ ] We keep track of socket connections with a dummy const value. This is dumb ?

### Architecural
- [ ] Secrets are hardcoded
- [ ] Github Actions / Gitlab CI

### Design
- [ ] Brainstorm about the extension (design, how we want it to be used)
- [ ] Brainstorm about the frontend (design, how we want it to be used)

## GOOD TO HAVE ?
- [ ] Add a way to input a code instead of scanning the QRCode
- [ ] Feed the device with a Queue (playlist ?)
